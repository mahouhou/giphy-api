# Accessing Giphy's API

## Perform a keyword search and return a gif

This project was part of the SuperHi ReactJS course. The user can enter a search term, this will query the Giphy API and return a set of gifs that match the keyword. The user then either can hit enter to see another random matching gif, or hit clear and start again.

During this project I learned how to:

* build class components with React
* set up state on the class e.g. a loading state
* create an asynchronous method with the `async` and `await` keywords
* write a `try`/`catch` statement for handling errors
* make an API request with the `fetch()` method
* convert JSON data into Javascript with the `json()` method
* create `onKeyPress` and `onChange` event handlers
* access user input value data
